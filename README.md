# upGrad Capstone Project - WeThePeople

##### Tools using: React , Express, Node JS, Mongo db etc

## Introduction

WeThePeople is a full-stack crowdfunding web application similar to Kickstarter and built using the MERN stack. Users will have the ability to create and manage crowdfunding campaigns while potential backers can browse, search, and contribute to projects of their choice.

Key components of the front-end may include a Navbar for global navigation, a Home page featuring highlighted projects, a Browse page for searching and filtering projects, a ProjectDetails page to display detailed information and backer tiers, a CreateProject page for project submission, and a UserProfile page for user account management. State management will be handled using Redux or the Context API.

The API will consist of routes to handle user authentication (sign up, log in, log out, password reset), user profile CRUD operations, project CRUD operations (including project updates), and contribution management (including backer tiers). Middleware will be utilized for tasks such as authentication, error handling, and input validation.
